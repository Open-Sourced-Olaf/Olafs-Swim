So, in order to play this repository you have to have Unity Hub installed as well as Unity. Make sure to specifically save Scenes because although the base files (sprites and scripts) and the Unity framework are unrelated, they still depend on the existence of a Scene.
The game.app file is the current status of our project (exported from Unity Hub)!
